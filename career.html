                    Born in 1974 in Los Angeles, California, Leonardo DiCaprio is an actor
                    known for his edgy, unconventional roles. He started out in television before
                    moving on to film, scoring an Oscar nomination for his role in What's Eating
                    Gilbert Grape (1993). In 1997, DiCaprio starred in James Cameron's epic drama
                    Titanic, which made him a huge star. The actor has also paired up with iconic
                    director Martin Scorsese for several projects, including The Aviator (2004) and
                    The Departed (2006). His more recent films include Inception (2010), Django
                    Unchained (2012), The Wolf of Wall Street (2013) and The Revenant (2015), winning
                    his first Oscar for the latter.
